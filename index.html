      <p>As gender lines become further beautifully blurred and women become increasingly empowered, the fashion will, well, follow suit! Yes, women in suits will be even more prominent in 2019.
        Suits are more androgynous these days, so much so that they can no longer be called "menswear." Suits are now also womenswear</p>

      <p>Fashion trends and details from decades past are always cyclical.

    <p>Jeans are a staple of every wardrobe, but the denim-on-denim trend can be hard to pull off and Canadian tuxedos are never truly cool. However, Jessica Mastriano, the buyer/curator of the TANGO Brooklyn boutique, says, "Denim is one of the biggest American heritage fashions we have. Wearing different washes and colors together will be big."
        But it's not just about light washes or distressed details when it comes to denim, either.
        "You can also expect to see patchwork styles and darker shades of denim," Mastriano furthers.
        "2019 is the year to get creative with denim."
